# Chapter 9 - Importing:
"""
Python comes with lots of pre-made code backed in. These pieces of code are known
as modules and packages. A module is a single importable Python file whereas
a package is made up of two or more modules. A package can be imported the same way a
module is. Whenever we save a Python script of our own, we have created a module.

"""
